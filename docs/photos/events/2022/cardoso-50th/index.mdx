    <blockquote>
      <p>My sisters and I would like to congratulate our parents on 50 years of marriage!</p>
      <p>We have been absolutely blessed to have them both as our parents.</p>
      <p>Growing up they taught us that marriage is hard work. As much as that is a clich√©, it the truth. Our parents always made sure to make that clear to us.</p>
      <p>They gave us such a priceless example of true unconditional love and commitment to one another. They showed us how to work together in a partnership, to compromise, sacrifice, to have determination and support one another. To make time for one another and our families. They taught us that love is not merely a word or phrase we tell one another but love is shown by actions.</p>
      <p>As a parent now, I strive to instill the same moral compass and qualities in my children that you both taught us.</p>
      <p>In three days Joao and I are celebrating 14 years of marriage... we could have been closer to 20 years but my parents told me they wouldn't pay my tuition if I moved out, so 14 it is!</p>
      <p>I pray the example you provided us helps me and my sisters all get to 50 years of marriage and that this legacy continues to your grandkids.</p>
