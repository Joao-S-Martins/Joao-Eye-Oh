  <h3>TODO (joao) Raquelle's speech text</h3>
  My sisters and I would like to congratulate our parents on 50 years of marriage!
  We have been absolutely blessed to have them both as our parents.
  Growing up they taught us that marriage is hard work. As much as that is a cliché, it the truth. Our parents always made sure to make that clear to us. 
  They gave us such a priceless example of true unconditional love and commitment to one another. They showed us how to work together in a partnership, to compromise, sacrifice, to have determination and support one another. To make time for one another and our families. They taught us that love is not merely a word or phrase we tell one another but love is shown by actions. 
  As a parent now, I strive to instill the same moral compass and qualities in my children that you both taught us.
  In three days Joao and I are celebrating 14 years of marriage…we could have been closer to 20 years but my parents told me they wouldn’t pay my tuition if I moved out….sooooo 14 it is!
  I pray the example you provided us helps me and my sisters all get to 50 years of marriage and that this legacy continues to your grandkids.
